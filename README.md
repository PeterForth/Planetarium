# Planetarium  for Win32forth
Small Planetarium for Win32forth  , this is a learning tool to teach basic graphic animations in the console. 
You do not have to open any special windows to make graphics on Win32forth, 
this way you can concentrate your efforts learning Forth, not Windows !

This is the kind of programmation we used on the  DOS Forths, 
and in my opinion it gives you greater productivity concentrating to the real  purpose of the program 
and not wasting time with "the environment" of your program.  The second intention is that 
forth novices see examples  of integer and general Forth math, an initiation to astronomy, 
and also to learn  how to  draw  function   outputs  to the screen. Would love to see
people adding functions to this basic Planetarium. Enjoy !
